A place for philosophical discussion of what's on most thinking minds.

We exist in a culture of narrative and media that increasingly, willfully combines agency-robbing fantasy mythos with instantaneous technological disseminationâ€”a self-mutating proteum of semantics: *the spectacle*.

If confused, please  [stick around](http://www.reddit.com/tb/2ncoxs) or [hover here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3dm0sp?context=10000 "We live in a culture that uses media to tell us how to live. Our culture purposefully creates fantasies that rob us of our freedom, and this is more effective with technology like the internet. This phenomenon is a self modifying cluster of symbols and signs that constantly change their meaning.

## Dashboard For AO Devs

Current Autonomous Organisation (AO) Development Effort

* [ao-react](https://github.com/coalition-of-invisible-colleges/ao-react/) : Creating a frontend for the AO software

* ao-bash: A set of bash scripts to install and configure AO instances, install the AO suite of free software, and enhance your UNIX system.

* ao-mini: Our reddit alternative. The newest version of the AO web server, ao-mini is a minimalist NodeJS server that passes most logic through to ao-bash scripts. (To be clear: ao-bash is the best way to install ao-mini.)

<!-- unsure if this is really active yet
* ao-mud: Included with ao-bash, ao-mud is a Multi-User Dungeon, or M.U.D., a text-based adventure that takes place in the terminal. This adds a narrative tutorial layer to UNIX that is multiplayer and also aids memory by turning folders into rooms that can be decorated as locations.

### FAQ regarding ao react

- Does it use Activity Pub?
  - Anders: I would like it to support this protocol but there are a few other more fundamental problems to solve first before we can add it
- Why Flatfile?
  - Anders: it's transparent, portable, we don't have to make an import/export feature. cards are still trapped in previous versions of AO databases
